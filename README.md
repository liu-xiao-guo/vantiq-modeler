This is a simple example showing how to make use of Vantiq modeler to fast prototype an application. On Vantiq, Modeler can be used by developers and business decision makers to collaborate to come out a graphic design, and it can be shared by multiple people. They can always co-work on the project.

Based on the Modeler, it can easily generate a Vantiq application. A developer may need to have some more steps to configure the activities, then the Vantiq can start to work.

In this example, it simulates a passenger wants to take a ride for a taxi (kuaiche in Chinese). It has two projects in the example:

1) modeler
2) kuaiche (generaetd from modeler)

If you want to import the project to Vantiq platform, please use the following command after you have cloned the repository:

vantiq -s ProfileNameInYourProfileFile import
vantiq -s ProfileNameInYourProfileFile import data
